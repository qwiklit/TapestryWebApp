Welcome to Tapestry Story Reader

This is a HTML/CSS/JS package that is usable on the web and will be portable for Android and iOS via Cordova. This is a working prototype, but some items will change once it is uploaded to Wordpress.

For now, the name of the homepage is "newspagecardcopy.html". You can access the remainder of the app from there.
